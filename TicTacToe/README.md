# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit). The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols (either X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface**: The game uses Java AWT for the graphical interface, providing an interactive experience.
- **Two-Player Mode**: Two players can take turns playing on the same device.
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects and announces the winner when three symbols are aligned.
- **Simple and Intuitive Layout**: The layout is managed using the Grid Layout manager, ensuring a neat and organized interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.


### How to Play

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Player 1 uses the symbol 'X', and Player 2 uses the symbol 'O'.
- Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their symbol in an empty cell.
- The game ends when one player aligns three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the grid is full without a winner (resulting in a draw).

## Project Structure

- `TicTacToe.java`: The main Java file containing the game logic and GUI setup.

## Technologies Used

- **Java AWT**: For creating the graphical user interface and handling events.
- **Grid Layout**: For organizing the grid layout of the game board, Grid Layout is used from the layout manager.
